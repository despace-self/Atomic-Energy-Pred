### GitHub Note: Atomic Energy State Prediction Inspired by Mass Effect's Mass Relay

---

#### **Project Overview**
This project is inspired by the concept of de-atomization and atomization used for interstellar transportation in the *Mass Effect* game's Mass Relay system. Our goal is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting atomic energy states using molecular features derived from quantum mechanical simulations.

By leveraging advanced regression techniques, we aim to lay the groundwork for future innovations in interstellar-scale transport and molecular energy prediction. The dataset and model presented here explore the intersection of computational chemistry, quantum mechanics, and machine learning.

#### **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains **16,242 molecules**, each described by molecular features derived from quantum mechanical simulations. Here's a breakdown of its structure:

- **Features (Columns 1-1275)**: Molecular features based on the Coulomb matrix.
- **PubChem ID (Column 1276)**: Identifier for the source molecular structures.
- **Target Variable (Column 1277)**: Atomization energy (in kcal/mol), calculated using the Quantum Espresso package.

*Note*: The first column (`X1`) serves as an index and is unused in the modeling process.

This dataset offers a rich and complex challenge for machine learning practitioners aiming to predict molecular properties with precision.

#### **Research Background**
This dataset has been previously used in a study published in the *Journal of Chemical Physics*. Additionally, a blog post was written to explain the data and its significance in less technical terms. 

For researchers interested in the origins of this dataset, a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/example) contains the source code used to generate the data and several R scripts for initial analysis.
